Use Android's voice recognition and TextToSpeach to turn a LED on or off on Raspberry Pi using Eclipse Paho Java Client library and a MQTT broker

I am new to programming and even newer to automation. I thought it was a good idea to create a project like this one to
get started. This project allows the user to turn on an LED on a Raspberry Pi using an Android device. It is a simple
app that allows an user to eneter voice commands to turn on or off a light. The default commands are "turn light on" and
"turn light off." Please read the comments on the Main.java and MQTTBaseClass.java to find links that will guide you through
the set up.
